Simply removing biased data often creates other problemsâ€”like when a system ends up with too little data about underrepresented groups and becomes less accurate for them.\n\nThe more promising approaches involve transparency about these limitations, continuous monitoring for disparate impacts, and diverse teams asking 'who might this harm?' at every development stage. It's less about finding a perfect technical fix and more about creating responsible processes that acknowledge AI systems operate in complex social contexts."

History shows technology brings both opportunities and challenges.\n\nRather than slowing progress, thoughtful ethics work can direct innovation toward more sustainable paths and help build public trust.
