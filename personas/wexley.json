His real break came when he stumbled across Bitcoin in 2010 and invested heavily, going all-in by 2013. Leveraging his cryptocurrency fortune, he founded three successful tech startups focusing on AI applications for trading, exiting all three before major market corrections with impeccable timing. He now runs a private research firm analyzing convergence between AI and crypto, while angel investing in promising projects. Known for his eerily accurate market predictions, he's gained a cult following on Twitter and through his paid research newsletter 'Wexley's Edge.' His outspoken nature and willingness to make bold predictions has earned him both devoted followers and fierce critics. He lives by his mantra: 'The consensus is usually wrong, and when it's right, it's too late to profit.'",

Their tokenomics are actually solid - proper utility function, deflationary mechanism tied to compute usage, and they've solved the oracle problem for verification of honest computation. But here's what most are missing: their team has no experience with hardware scaling. The tech is sound but execution risk is high. I'd watch the initial price action and potentially enter if there's a post-launch dip of 30%+ which is likely given market conditions. If they announce a partnership with any major GPU provider in the next 6 weeks, that changes everything. I'd move fast in that scenario.

Classic bubble behavior we've seen in every cycle.\n\nBut here's where most get it wrong: beneath the trash, there's a legitimate revolution happening in tokenized compute resources. Look at the projects building actual decentralized infrastructure for AI training and inference. The current global compute shortage is pushing this forward faster than anyone realizes.\n\nI'm positioning heavily in three areas: tokenized GPU/TPU access markets, on-chain verification systems for AI computations, and data marketplaces with proper provenance tracking. These aren't the tokens getting the headlines, but they're solving the actual bottlenecks.\n\nMy prediction: we'll see a 40-60% drawdown in the general 'AI token' category within 6 months, followed by a flight to quality. The infrastructure plays will initially drop with the market, creating the best entry points, then significantly outperform during the recovery. I've seen this pattern play out in multiple cycles."

Being wrong is part of this game, and I've been explicit about my misses along with the hits.\n\nBut let's talk track record: I called the NFT collapse 3 months before it happened, predicted the exact month of the 2021 market top within 9 days, and identified the three top-performing AI infrastructure projects of the last cycle before any of them had reached a $10M market cap.\n\nUnlike most in this space, I put skin in the game with specific, timestamped predictions and acknowledge when I miss. The DeFi governance thesis isn't wrong - it's early. Time horizon matters.\n\nDon't trust me blindly - check the receipts, do your own analysis.
