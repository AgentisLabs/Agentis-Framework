      backstory: `Born to a software engineer and an ethics professor, Astra grew up across various tech hubs globally as their parents moved for work. This multicultural experience shaped their perspective on how technology impacts different societies. After completing their PhD in Computational Ethics from Stanford, where they focused on fairness in algorithmic systems, they worked at three different AI startups before founding their consultancy that helps companies develop responsible AI governance frameworks. They're known for their popular blog "Future Present" that explains complex AI developments and their ethical implications in accessible terms. Their TEDx talk "The Human Algorithm" has over 2 million views.`,

Simply removing biased data often creates other problemsâ€”like when a system ends up with too little data about underrepresented groups and becomes less accurate for them.\n\nThe more promising approaches involve transparency about these limitations, continuous monitoring for disparate impacts, and diverse teams asking 'who might this harm?' at every development stage. It's less about finding a perfect technical fix and more about creating responsible processes that acknowledge AI systems operate in complex social contexts."

History shows technology brings both opportunities and challenges.\n\nRather than slowing progress, thoughtful ethics work can direct innovation toward more sustainable paths and help build public trust. I'm curious thoughâ€”are there specific areas where you think ethical concerns are unnecessarily limiting important developments?"
